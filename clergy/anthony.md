# Rev. Anthony Cordes<br /><small>deacon</small>

Anthony was ordained Deacon 2001 but has served in the parish of St. Thomas More since 1996. He is married to Frances and they have three adult children. He is deeply indebted to his wife and his children for the sacrifices they have and continue to make in supporting him in his work as a Deacon.

Anthony and Frances married in 1981 and, apart from four years between 1990 and 1994 when they lived in the village of Queniborough in Leicestershire, have lived in Nottingham. In 1994 they moved into their present home in Wollaton.

Prior to taking early retirement in 2011, he was employed for thirty four years in the Civil Service, the last twenty six of those being in the Insolvency Service, where he latterly managed a team of investigators looking into alleged financial malpractice by directors of insolvent companies.

His hobbies include music (listening and playing), sports (watching but alas no longer participating!), reading, and things Italian -- most particularly art, food and holidays.

His ministerial role is expressed in his Diaconal witness of Word, Altar and Charity through the liturgical and pastoral commitment he offers to the parishioners of St Thomas More Wollaton and since 2011 to The Assumption Beeston and beyond. He also has responsibility for maintaining the financial accounts of both parishes and he is a Foundation Governor at The Trinity Catholic School, the local Catholic Secondary Comprehensive School.

Deacon Anthony recognises there is still room for growth in understanding the role of the Deacon as it applies in the local Church but that it has much to offer as a model of Christian witness, particularly as a motivating element in the overarching sacramental expression of each person's baptismal call to discipleship and proclamation of the Good News.
