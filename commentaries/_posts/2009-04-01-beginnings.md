# Beginnings
 
So just how do you begin a Gospel? You may think that this is a rather odd question to ask but presumably Mark had to ask himself this question. How was he to start a genre of work that no-one else had yet attempted? What words could he use to describe what he wanted to say? What phrase could he employ that would convey the importance of what he wanted to put across? I wonder just how long he sat in front of a blank papyrus scroll scratching his head before he decided? And surely the sentence he chose and wrote provides us with all the evidence we need to show us that his words are inspired. The beginning of the Good News about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. You may think that it was simplicity itself but if we start to delve into that sentence, and begin to examine and explore all that it contains, we will find such depth and beauty, such insight and understanding that it provides the most exquisite exposition of what his book unfolds. 
 
The word beginning ironically takes us back. Back to the very start, to the first book of the Bible and to the Creation story itself. This link tells us that Mark’s story will connect us with the very author of creation who Himself is the author of this story too. This word defines the context in which Mark will set his narrative. It is a universal context that bridges all time as it arcs back to the very moment of creation in order to span the vast and immense expanse of the ages, and then sweeps forward as it opens for us the possibilities we are about to encounter.  
 
The words Good News which is what gospel means come from the Greek word euangelion. This word was used in the ancient world to signify the passing of an important or significant event. A victory in battle was proclaimed as good news. The pronouncement of a decree by the Emperor was presented to the world as good news. As such then the word was associated with the proclamation of major events of great significance to the people as a whole. Mark takes this word and attaches it to the event which he is about to unfold. The proclamation that Mark is about to make is therefore of major importance to all people.
 
Who though is this good news about? Mark tells us it is about Jesus Christ. Jesus is the Christus, the Anointed One, the Messiah, the Chosen One. Mark is telling us of Jesus’ importance and of his closeness to God. As yet we know nothing about him. No information is given about him as an individual. No information is given about his roots, his family or where he comes from. These facts will be revealed in the verses that follow. For the purpose of this beginning, it is sufficient to know that the story Mark is going to tell, relates to a person who is so important that he can be called Son of God. And so the end of the sentence links with its start since they enfold what is to happen within God’s plan for humanity.
 
On this Second Sunday of Advent we are given a glimpse of a theology. It has been condensed into one sentence that at the very beginning of the story encapsulates the message in a timeless framework that both reaches back to make sense of the past and stretches forward to clear a pathway into the future. A voice cries in the wilderness: Prepare a way for the Lord, make his paths straight. Good News I’d say!
